Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls)."	22180495	PubMed		"Yang et al., 2012, Cancer Res."		2	accepted	99	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/99	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	FALSE	BRAF	673	V600E		chr7	140753336	140753336	A	T	ENST00000288602.6	75		missense_variant	"NM_004333.4:c.1799T>A,NP_004324.2:p.Val600Glu,NC_000007.13:g.140453136A>T,ENST00000288602.6:c.1799T>A"	2023-01-27 17:02:02 UTC	CA123643	"13,961,376,069"	"RS113488022,VAL600GLU,V640E,VAL640GLU"	FALSE

The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib).

Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie.

Of patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs, 71 (83.5%) had a partial response, 7 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 3 were nonassessable.  Patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with KIT exon 9 mutations (P=.0006)  or double WT kinases (WT KIT and WT PDGFRA; P < .0001). The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was the strongest predictor of response (Hazard ratio= 7.85). Patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 687 days) than those with  KIT exon 9 mutant or double WT kinase GISTs (200 days and 82 days, respectively). Furthermore, patients whose tumors expressed an exon 11 mutant KIT had improved overall survival compared to patients whose tumor expressed an exon 9 mutant KIT (P = .0034)  or double WT kinases (P <.0001)."	14645423	PubMed		"Heinrich et al., 2003, J.

Seven molecularly characterized cases were positive for CLTC-ALK.  6/7 patients were treated with CHOP chemotherapy with survival of 5, 10, 26 and 27 months, and two alive at end of study, and one CD20 positive patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy supplemented with CD20-targeted rituximab, with survival of 8 months, resulting in median survival of 26 months for this group.  Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort."	19636007	PubMed		"Laurent et al., 2009, J.

ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue.

Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after.

SOX10 Loss	668	Melanoma	1909		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-Î² signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-Î² becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-Î² signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.	24670642	PubMed		"Sun et al., 2014, Nature"		4	accepted	1710	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1710	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/668	FALSE	SOX10	6663	Loss		chr22	37972300	37984537			ENST00000396884.2	75		loss_of_function_variant		2023-01-09 21:52:08 UTC		N/A		FALSE

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. KPL4 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA H1047R, and it had an IC50 of 0.28uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, and allowed to grow. Subsequently, pictilisib was administered orally daily for 14 days. Mice treated with 100mg/kg experienced a 76% tumor reduction, and those treated with 150mg/kg experienced a 90% tumor reduction, with respect to untreated control. Phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced with pictilisib administration. Three other HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R: UACC-893, HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, which had IC50s of 0.41uM, 0.49uM, and 0.64uM, suggesting that PIK3CA H1047R induces sensitivity to pictilisib in HER2 amplified breast cancer.

Patients with KRAS wildtype, NRAS assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=301) were genotyped for NRAS mutations. Patients harboring NRAS mutant tumors (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype NRAS (n=289; 1/13 [7.7%] vs 110/289 [77.9%]; p =.013). However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment.

Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants.

Patients with KRAS wildtype, PIK3CA assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=339) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Patients harboring PIK3CA mutant tumors (n=34) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype PIK3CA (6/34 [17.7%] vs 115/305 [37.7%]; p =.015). Patients with mutant PIK3CA also experienced lower disease control rate in response to cetuximab treatment. However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype PIK3CA in progression free or overall survival (median PFS: 18 vs 24 weeks; median OS: 39 vs 51 weeks).

Mice injected with KRAS wt cells did not significantly respond to regorafenib, although a trend was seen toward better response. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed no significant change in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31) and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS G12C expressing mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS wt expressing mice whose tumors displayed more pronounced changes.

In all patients with multiple affected family members the mutation segregated with the disease. Large deletions or intragenic mutations predicted to cause a truncated protein were found in 36 of 53 families without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1) and 2 of 12 families with pheochromocytoma (VHL type 2). This mutation causes a frameshift and premature stop codon at amino acid 131 and was found in a VHL type 1 patient (kindred no. 110). This variant is likely to cause a dramatic alteration in protein function in a gene where loss-of-function mutations are a known mechanism (ACMG code: PVS1).

The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing.

These tumors were studied for a relationship between RRM1 expression and chemotherapy regimens, gemcitabine, docetaxel and carboplatin, and vinorelbine and carboplatin. In the patients receiving gemcitabine treatment, the progression-free survival of RRM1-negative patients was significantly higher than that of RRM1-positive patients (8.8 months vs. 7.6 months, P = 0.01).

Patients with low expression experienced shorter progression free survival than those with no loss of expression (P<0.01). In a multivariate analysis it was found that a loss of ARID1A expression was significant for shorter disease free survival (P=0.03) and shorter overall survival for patients whose ovarian clear cell carcinoma was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (P=0.015).

A metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma sample (sample 3087) was obtained from a 68 year old male who was known to smoke one pack of cigarettes per day and had intense alcohol drinking habits. In this patient's tumor (sample 3087), a c.551T>C variant (noted in the paper as nucleotide 764) was identified as a somatic mutation, found only in the tumor. The second mutation, a C>G transversion, c.183C>G (p.P61=) (noted in the paper at nucleotide 396) was present in the non-tumor DNA, a germline synonymous mutation. The patient had no metastasis after nephrectomy and patients survival was >4 months. ACMG codes: none."	7591282	PubMed		"Bailly et al., 1995, Int. J.

ABL1 R351W	1564	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	"In this in vitro study, the H1915 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (homozygous for a R351W mutation) was shown to be susceptible to imatinib. This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses."	26758680	PubMed		"Testoni et al., 2016, EMBO Mol Med"		5	accepted	6376	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:47 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6376	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1564	FALSE	ABL1	25	R351W		chr9	130872946	130872946	C	T	ENST00000372348.2	75		missense_variant	"ENST00000372348.2:c.1051C>T,NC_000009.11:g.133748333C>T,NM_007313.2:c.1051C>T,NP_009297.2:p.Arg351Trp"	2023-01-27 17:11:10 UTC	CA5285359	NONE FOUND	"R332W,ARG351TRP,RS779478267"	FALSE

This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 Ã 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2).

In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib.

Resistance of V441G to cetuximab was modeled in silico, and authors predicted that it destroys a critical hydrophobic node. In vitro, V441G/D transduced NIH3T3 cells had significantly reduced binding to panitumumab and cetuximab compared to EGFR wt NH3T3 cells (p<0.01 for all comparisons to wt).

All 10 cases that were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant were either the spindle cell (3/12) or the sclerosing (7/9) subtypes of RMS, while all 10 cases of the embryonal subtype of RMS were negative for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant. The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype. Finally, the study confirmed the negative correlation between the aforementioned subtypes with the embryonal subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma."	27562493	PubMed		"Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

MYOD1 L122R	2901	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	"This study evaluated forty-nine cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (17 cases of alveolar RMS, 10 of embryonal RMS, 21 of spindle cell and sclerosing RMS, and a single case of a pleomorphic RMS) for MYOD1 (L122R), PIK3CA (H1047), and PIK3CA (E542/E545) mutations. 10/49 cases were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant, and all the positive cases belonged to either spindle cell or sclerosing RMS subtype. None of the embryonal RMS cases was positive for the MYOD1 L122R variant. All cases were treated with surgical resection and either adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or both. On patient follow-up, the alive-with-disease ratio was higher in the adult than in the pediatric population. Furthermore, the patients positive for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-positive states on follow-up, while the patients negative for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-free states on follow-up. This suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.34)."	27562493	PubMed		"Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

BRAF V600E	12	Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma	3969		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	"Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naÃ¯ve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2)."	27460442	PubMed		"Brose et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol."

This cohort was split into two groupsâBRAF+ and BRAF-. Of the 107 patients that were BRAF+, 25% had tumor reoccurrence compared with 9% in the BRAF- group (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess BRAF correlation independent of known contributing factors to cancer such as age, gender, and multifocality. The results showed that the BRAF mutation is indicative/contributes to lymph node metastasis, associated with tumor reoccurrence, stage, and that recurrent disease was more extensive and required more aggressive treatments in BRAF+ patients compared with BRAF- patients.

One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease.

In FOXO1 fusion-positive RMS subtype, there was a small number of cases with altered TP53 (3 and 2 cases in the COG and UK patient cohorts, respectively), but they were universally fatal. Due to lack of a matched germline sample, it could not be determined whether the TP53 abnormalities were of somatic or germline origin.

The study found that in men with mCRPC who had somatic or germline deleterious alterations (irrespective of zygosity) in any of the following HRR genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRIP1, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L), olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone (PFS HR 0.49 [0.38, 0.63]). For 15 patients with BRCA1 mutations specifically, PFS HR 0.41 [0.13-1.39]. .
