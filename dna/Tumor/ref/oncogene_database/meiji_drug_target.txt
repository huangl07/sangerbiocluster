Authors note that The ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript predicts the the synthesis of ZMIZ1-ABL fusion protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and ABL tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that promotes cellular transformation. The authors further note that patients with t(9;10) would be eligible for imatinib treatment."	"Soler et al., 2008, Leukemia"	Somatic	ENST00000334512.5	transcript_fusion

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02)."	"O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin. Cancer Res."

The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype.

There was one case of predominantly spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with the MYOD-1 mutation that also contained a PIK3CA mutation. The case with both MYOD-1 and PIK3CA mutations consisted histologically of lipoblasts within focally myxoid stroma, thus demonstrating that the PIK3CA mutation was a secondary aberration while MYOD-1 was the primary neomorphic mutation. On clinical follow-up, seven of the MYOD-1 variant cases experienced local recurrences and/or metastatic disease. In a median of a 13.5 month follow-up, there was 1 patient who passed away, 8 patients who were alive with the disease, and 3 patients who were alive without the disease; there was no correlation with the type of treatment that the patients had received.

Molecular testing included 39 genes which had been implicated in the past with regards to RMS. The analysis was performed with a custom-capture sequencing assay. Altered TP53 was noted in 69 out of 515 FOXO1 fusion-negative RMS cases (13%), with the most frequent mutations at codons G245S (6 cases), R248Q or W (6 cases), R175H (4 cases), and P72A (4 cases). These cases displayed a worse event free survival. In FOXO1 fusion-positive RMS subtype, there was a small number of cases with altered TP53 (3 and 2 cases in the COG and UK patient cohorts, respectively), but they were universally fatal. Due to lack of a matched germline sample, it could not be determined whether the TP53 abnormalities were of somatic or germline origin.

CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline.

In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK.

SOX10 Loss	SOX10	Loss	Melanoma	Vemurafenib	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	chr22	37972300	37984537			FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-脦虏 signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-脦虏 becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-脦虏 signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.

Gene expression profiling showed P21 gene was expressed at a higher level (1.7 folds) in mutant receptor cells, providing evidence of ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 activation. The mutant receptor produced a highly sustained ERK1/2 activation even after 1 hour of PDGF treatment, whereas wild-type expressing cells showed a decrease in ERK1/2 activity.

There was no difference of H3K27Me2 and H3K9Me3 levels between Y641F/N and WT, indicating specificity in a gain of function of Y641F/N. Expression of Y641N mutation in HEK293T cells with wild-type EZH2 led to an increase in H3K27me3. Structural modeling indicated that Y641F/N helped push the equilibrium to favor trimethylated products. A 3H methyl incorporation assay was used to study the activity of the PRC2 complex containing Y641N mutation in vitro. PRC2 complexes containing Y641N showed nearly two times higher activity with H3K27me2 substrates than PRC complexes with wild-type EZH2. This study indicates that EZH2 (Y641N) increases H3K27 trimethylation."	"Yap et al., 2011, Blood"	Somatic	ENST00000320356.7	missense_variant

Re-introduction of ATRX rescued cells from 5-FU treatment. Similar significant (P<0.05) increases in TUNEL-positive cells were seen for ATRX-deficient neurons treated with 5-FU, as well as myoblasts and embryonic fibroblasts treated with 5-FU or cisplatin.
